@article{Hall1995,
abstract = {The electrotopological state formalism is developed further in conjunction with atom classification. The classification scheme is based on the characteristics of hydride groups: (1) atomic number of an atom as element identifier, (2) a valence state designation consisting of valence and simple connectivity 6 values (for each atom together with its bonded hydrogen atoms, as in -CH3 or -NH-), and (3) an aromaticity indicator. This scheme may be viewed as a three-dimensional array. In a few cases, bonded neighbor analysis is also required. The scheme is developed and illustrated. For each atom type in a molecule, the electrotopological state indices are summed. These atom type E-state indices, based on a summation of E-state values, are useful for database characterization, molecular similarity analysis, and QSAR. A QSAlU QSPR example is given for boiling point for a set of 245 alkanes and alcohols for which the standard error is 8.0 "C},

    abstract = {{JAMA} is a basic linear algebra package for Java. It provides user-level classes for constructing and manipulating real, dense matrices. It is meant to provide sufficient functionality for routine problems, packaged in a way that is natural and understandable to non-experts. It is intended to serve as the standard matrix class for Java, and will be proposed as such to the Java Grande Forum and then to Sun. A straightforward public-domain reference implementation has been developed by the {MathWorks} and {NIST} as a strawman for such a class. We are releasing this version in order to obtain public comment. There is no guarantee that future versions of {JAMA} will be compatible with this one.},

The results from the investigation show remarkably stable performance from the derived in silico models in terms of statistical measures such as correlation coefficients as well as root mean squared errors (RMSEs) for the randomly selected external test sets. Also, the Bioclipse Modeling platform is utilized for introducing interpretation to the derived models.},

  abstract ={Motivation: High-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) is among the most widely used technologies in metabolomics. Metabolites participate in almost all cellular processes, but most metabolites still remain uncharacterized. Determination of the sum formula is a crucial step in the identification of an unknown metabolite, as it reduces its possible structures to a hopefully manageable set.Results: We present a method for determining the sum formula of a metabolite solely from its mass and the natural distribution of its isotopes. Our input is a measured isotope pattern from a high resolution mass spectrometer, and we want to find those molecules that best match this pattern. Our method is computationally efficient, and results on experimental data are very promising: for orthogonal time-of-flight mass spectrometry, we correctly identify sum formulas for >90% of the molecules, ranging in mass up to 1000 Da.Availability: SIRIUS is available under the LGPL license at http://bio.informatik.uni-jena.de/sirius/Contact: anton.pervukhin@minet.uni-jena.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
